# Velocity of Bitcoin
-----------------------------------------
## Paper 1:
Conceptionally we do:
- propose a modified velocity measure based on Marx's theory of money, that allows for using it as measure for the "moneyness" of cryptocurrencies
- Show that Ricardian Velocity of money is affected by hype and actually incomplete due to offchain-exchange trading
- Our measure measure peer-to-peer transactions for money circulating within a certain period
- It can easily be smoothed for nicer monitoring

We do also:
- Compare velocity measures and past, simplified, used approximations
- Compare a sample of UTXO-based coins for their moneyness
- Compare the Ricardian velocity and Marxian velocity (are these names to dangerous from theory aspect) wrt. reactions to hype phases

## Paper 2:
- Use our data on time-window based Velocity measures to find a data driven "best" factor for asset pricing model

## Paper 3 (?):
- Test hypothesis: "Medium of exchange"->"Boom"->"No money"->"Bust"->"Medium of exchange"-> etc.
