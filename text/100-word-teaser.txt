The velocity of money is a central yet unobservable concept for fiat money.
Public blockchains, in contrast, allow to measure -- rather than approximate
-- velocity.  However, for cryptocurrencies the dichotomy of means for
transactions and (speculative) assets storing value is particularly stark.
We thus develop velocity measures for UTXO-based cryptocurrencies focused on
the subset of the money supply effectively in circulation (and free and
open-source code).  We show the velocity measures are approximated best by
the simple ratio of on-chain transaction volume to total coin supply, while
the common proxy "coin days destroyed" shows considerable discrepancy.
