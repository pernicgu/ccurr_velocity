\section{Velocity of money in effective circulation}
\label{sec:newmeas}%
%
While these measures advanced quantifying the velocity of cryptocurrencies,
they suffer from inaccuracy as money supply is defined as ``the aggregate of
all monetary units ever issued'' ($\MTotalP$).  We therefore propose a
measure based on the component of money that circulates effectively. %
Denoting this circulating amount $\MCircP$, our measure yields
\begin{align}%
  \label{eq:vcirc_concept}
  \VCircEstP = \frac{\langle\Pp,\Tp\rangle}{\MCircP}.%
\end{align}%
%
% $\VCircP$ handles re-activated money gracefully, allowing %
% for a deeper glance into the economics of the cryptocurrency markets. %
% If money supply responds to price trends, not only numerator but also %
% denominator change. %
% For more or less money in potentially being available for transactions, %
% $\VCircP$ reflects, whether this money indeed has been %
% used for processing transactions and to which degree. %

\subsection{Formal derivation}
\label{sec:formal-derivation}

To see how excluding hoarded money relates to the quantity theory, expand the
sum in \refequ{velo_concept} and differentiate the set of all monetary units
treated as investment, $h$, from its complement
$\GStrokeP\coloneqq\Gp\setminus\{h\}$:
\begin{alignat}{4}%
  \VTotalP%
  \ & = &\ & \vp_h \frac{%
    \Np_h%
  }{%
    \bigl( \Np_h+\sum_{g\in\GStrokeP} \Np_g \bigr)%
  }\\%
  \ & \ + &\ & \sum_{g\in\GStrokeP} \vp_g \frac{%
    \Np_g%
  }{%
    \bigl( \Np_h+\sum_{g\in\GStrokeP} \Np_g \bigr)%
  }.\nonumber%
\end{alignat}%
%
By definition, $h$ encompasses only non-transferred units, and thus $\vp_h=0$
in period $\perd$. Consequently %
% For a large fraction of money supply $\Np_z=0$ held %
% as investment, the respective turnover rate $\vp_z$ receives a %
% large weight %
% \begin{align}
% \frac{\Np_z}{\bigl( \Np_z+\sum_{g\in\GStrokeP} \Np_g \bigr)},
% \end{align} %
% while the components of actively used money supply receive a %
% small weight. %
% Velocity measured in the above way %
% thus yields values close to zero, making the variable slightly abstract in its %
% interpretation. %

% Money switching from \textit{hoarded} to \textit{in circulation} %
% increases or decreases the measure. %
% Thus, a change in the measure $\VTotalEstP$ could either mean that "effectively %
% circulating monetary units on average being turned over more times" or %
% "formerly illiquid monetary units are being now used for transactions". %
% %
% Measure $\VCircP$ reduces the equation to% 
\begin{align}%
  \label{eq:disentangle_vcirc}
  \VCircP %
  =  \sum_{g\in\GStrokeP} \vp_g
  \frac{\Np_g}{\sum_{g\in\GStrokeP} \Np_g },%
\end{align}%
% where group $h$, hoarded money, is not considered.
% , an interpretation of a change in $\VCircP$ can here clearly %
% be attributed to a higher intensity of turnover for the circulating money stock. %
% Assuming that self-churn transactions in the calculation of %
% the transaction volumes have been filtered out effectively, the measure %
% might be interpreted as a proxy for the %
% \textbf{average number of peer-to-peer hops that effectively circulating %
% 	money units where able to achieve} in period $\perd$. 
Hence, the measure can be interpreted as the average number of turnovers of
units effectively circulating in period $\perd$. %
Dropping non-circulating money in \refequ{disentangle_vcirc} amounts to an
adjustment of the money supply $\Mp$ in the quantity equation
\eqref{eq:fisher}.  %

\subsection{Theoretical basis and practical considerations}
An advantage of basing velocity on money in effective circulation is higher
information content. %
To begin with, it is questionable whether $\VNaiveEst$ and $\VTotalEst$
capture more information than transaction volumes $\langle\Pp,\Tp\rangle$,
respectively $\langle\Pp',\Tp'\rangle$. %
After all, for most UTXO-based cryptocurrencies money supply is just a simple
function of block height.%
\footnote{Difficulty adjustments for mining lead to close-to-constant spans
  between block creation times \citep{tschorsch2016bitcoin}.} %
% So far, there are only few cryptocurrencies that implement a responsive %
% money supply.%
% \footnote{%
%   Some so called ``stablecoins'' developed with the goal of a more stable %
%   purchasing power are trying to implement a coin supply matching the %
%   demand (compare \cite{klages2019stability}, \cite{routledge2018currency}, %
%   \cite{sidorenko2019stablecoin} \cite{pernice2019monetary} or \cite{bullmann2019search}).%
% } %
Thus, the two former measures appear very close to merely scaled versions of
their price-sums. %

Moreover, the total coin supply used in $\VNaiveEst$ and $\VTotalEst$
includes money that is technical dysfunctional (burnt coins). %
Yet also coins held unused as storage of wealth\footnote{Compare
  \cite{sawyer2003money} for a detailed discussion of the discrepancy arising
  from money as storage of wealth.} %
or speculation\footnote{Most studies conclude cryptocurrencies are currently used more for
  long-term speculation rather than as media of exchange %
  (see \eg \cite{%
    bouri2019herding,%
    anderson2019bitcoin,%
    yang2018behavioral,%
    yermack2015bitcoin%
  }).
  % The degree to which monetary units are hold unused can be %
  % seen e.g. in \cite{kalodner2017blocksci}, who find that over the last 10 years only roughly %
  % \SI{20}{\percent} of Bitcoins were %
  % spent again within a month. %
} %
do not fulfill one of the key functions of money, use as medium of exchange.%

\end{figure*}%

Furthermore, the amount of money frozen in speculative investments might not
be neutral to money flows or prices. %
Since the beginnings of monetary economics, currency speculation has been
associated with patterns in price levels. %
In \cite{fullarton1845regulation} and \cite{marx1872kapital}, the illiquid
component is considered a reservoir for neutralizing demand shocks and
excluded from the money supply. %
For \cite{keynes1930treatise} and \cite{commons2003institutional} hoarded
money, as destroyed money, is \emph{leakage} which must be compensated to
stabilise the price level. %
\cite{fisher1911equation} associates the rise in market prices for one of the
early fiat U.S.\ bank notes with a relation of speculation and circulating
money as well: ``speculation acted as a regulator of the quantity of
money.'' %

Our proposed measure captures precisely this velocity of money in effective
circulation.  %
This perspective is already present in current theoretical research on
cryptocurrency prices.  %
For instance, the model of \cite{bolt2016value} distinguishes demand for
transactions from demand for rational speculation.
%and assume that a fiat currency is serving as denominator of value. %
When using the quantity equation, they deduct coins bought and held as
speculative investment. % and adjust it to cope with exchange rates between
%cryptocurrency and fiat money. %
Their modified quantity equation relates the exchange rate between fiat and
cryptocurrency $S_{\perd}$ to the velocity of cryptocurrency in effective
circulation $\VCircP$ and the volume of transactions $\Tp^{\ast}$ denominated
in units of cryptocurrency as %
\begin{align}
  S_{\perd} = \frac{\Tp^{\ast} / \VCircP}{\MCircP}.
\end{align}

The speculators in the model purchase cryptocurrency units if traded prices
lie below their risk-adjusted, discounted expected future price.  %
With increasing aggregate speculative positions, the risk of marginal
speculative investments rises, lowering the price speculators are willing to
pay.  %
On the other hand, higher speculative positions imply reduced $\MCircP$ and
increase current price according to their modified quantity equation.  %
A similar relation between money in circulation and speculation is modelled in
\cite{athey2016bitcoin} as well.  %

Hence, implicitly or explicitly theoretical research already employs velocity
based on circulating money rather than the total money supply.  %
We close the gap in empirical research by operationalizing the
circulation-based velocity measure for UTXO-based cryptocurrencies.  %

% START: BRING BACK?
% \par Calculating velocity this way solves the bias by including %
% coins with lost private keys, as they are excluded as sub-component of money with a velocity of zero. %
% % Besides certain incomplete lists%
%b % \footnote{%
% % 	See for example \url{%
% % 		https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/List_of_Major_Bitcoin_Heists,_Thefts,_and_Losses%
% % 	}%
% % }, %
% % there is currently no way to clearly disentangle to two. %
% While concrete numbers are hard to estimate, locking cryptocurrency forever by losing %
% the respective private keys is seen as a major challenge for %
% cryptocurrencies (compare \cite{meiklejohn2018top}). %
% END: BRING BACK?

% We therefore want to adopt a different approach, which might be summarized as "money is what money does."%
% \footnote{This phrase was coined by \cite{dalton1965primitive} as functional %
%   definition of money in response to a stream of academic arguments in %
%   search for a normative set of characteristics an asset should represent %
%   to be classified as "money".} %
% meaning that money which is not used for transactions but hoarded would be excluded. %
% In~\cite{fisher1911equation}, "money" is defined ambiguously as money in circulation. %
% "In circulation" might be just broadly referring to money hold by the %
% population with the potential to be used in transactions at any moment in %
% time---the approach used so far. %
% However, "in circulation" might also be referred to money that is, in deed, %
% moved within a certain period. %
% \footnote{This question frames a major debate in monetary policy research %
% which is the source the different money measures "MO", "M1", etc. that group %
% money components with similar liquidity.} %
% \par Given the hybrid role of cryptocurrencies, being designed as medium of exchange but %
% mostly used as speculative asset, segregation of the money supply is an %
% intuitive step.%
% Given the historic dominance of commodity money (e.g. coins and notes based on %
% precious metals), there are models trying to solve a similar challenge. %
% Based on \cite{fullarton1845regulation}, the so-called \textit{anti-quantity theory %
% of money} proposed by \cite{marx1872kapital} divides money supply into %
% \textit{money taking the form of hoards} and \textit{circulating} money. %
% % However, also \cite{fisher1911equation} noted that speculation might %
% % act as "[...] regulator of the quantity of money [...]". %
% For \cite{keynes1930treatise} and \cite{commons2003institutional} hoarded money, as %
% destroyed money, is ``[...] leakage [...]'' that needs to be compensated. %
% In \cite{fullarton1845regulation} and \cite{marx1872kapital} the illiquid %
% component is used as reservoir for demand shocks and excluded from %
% the quantity equation of money. %
% In- and outflow into the pool of circulating money is governed by the %
% \textit{law of reflux}. %
% Summarized, the law of reflux states that money leaves the pool of %
% hoards exclusively for enabling %
% trades---and flows back immediately after the trade has been accomplished. %
%
% \par Certain asset pricing approaches like~\cite{bolt2016value} or~\cite{athey2016bitcoin} %
% take up this thought and differentiate between money in circulation %
% and money hold as speculative investment. %
% Both model the price discovery processes to depend on the amount of money %
% effectively circulating. %
% This amount tightly interacts with money hoards from speculation leading to %
% feedback effects between speculation and price development via the supply of %
% money in circulation. %
% The degree to which monetary units are hold as long-term investments can be %
% seen e.g. in \cite{kalodner2017blocksci}, who find that over time only roughly %
% \SI{20}{\percent} of Bitcoins are %
% spent again within a month. %
% %
%

% Additionally, e.g., for Bitcoin it is yet unknown to the public whether the %
% money supply mined by Satoshi Nakamoto has just has stayed unused so far or %
% whether its keys have been destroyed. %
% \footnote{%
% 	According to an estimation by the cryptocurrency exchange \emph{BitMex} %
% 	over 600.000 Bitcoin might have been mined by %
% 	Satoshi Nakamoto---a pseudonym for the developer or developing group of %
% 	Bitcoin. Note that this is only a rough estimate based on the founders %
% 	mining behavior. %
% 	Compare \url{https://blog.bitmex.com/satoshis-1-million-bitcoin/}. %
% } %
%
% Depending on the application field of the velocity estimate, %
% this might be an advantage or disadvantage. %
% \footnote{In contrast, the large influence of monetary units switching from %
% $\Np_0$ to $\Np_11$ with $\vp_1 = 1$, might be desired when %
% using velocity as regressor in price predictions. %
% Then, however, one might argue that off-chain transactions on exchanges %
% should be taken into account as well, while they should be excluded when %
% utilizing the measure as estimate of "moneyness".} %
%
% Second, most cryptocurrencies are currently used mostly for speculation and %
% rarely for peer-to-peer transactions %
% (e.g. \cite{bouri2019herding}, \cite{corbet2019cryptocurrencies} or %
% \cite{yang2018behavioral}). %
% This, in turn, leads to a large fraction of unspent transaction outputs %
% being temporarily deprived from being used for transactions. %
% Appreciating cryptocurrency prices might draw large fractions of the %
% hoarding component into circulation, distorting measures for the %
% fundamental use of the cryptocurrency as medium of exchange.
% 
% More importantly, the radical exclusion of money supply unused for %
% processing transactions within a certain period leads to a very helpful interpretation:
% The velocity %
% $V_{\perd, name-for-new} = \frac{\Pp \Tp}{\MCircP}$ 
% of coins used within a certain period can be interpreted as %
% \textbf{the number of peer-to-peer hops}, the respective coins are %
% able to accomplish on average in that period.%
% The measure has a lower bound of 1, providing an intuitive means to compare %
% the use of different cryptocurrenes as medium of exchange. %
% \footnote{Note that the rather simplistic arithmetic formulation is made %
% concrete and applicable for UTXO-based cryptocurrencies in \refsec{oldmeas:sub:types}.} %
% This measure, in contrast to the Ricardian definition of the velocity of money, %
% is constructed to be robust against distortions from hype-driven single-hop %
% transactions to exchanges. %
% \todo{This is still somewhat weak. The more evidence here, the better we %
% can show why the world needs our measure.}
%
% While the Ricardian measure would increase with the surge of long-term %
% investments being transferred to exchanges and traded there off-chain, %
% the above measure only increases when the same coin performs various transactions. %
% We thus see the above measure as a useful indicator for the "moneyness" %
% of a cryptocurrency. %
% While cryptocurrency prices are a  simple and widely used success indicator, %
% a measure for the use of the digital asset for peer-to-peer transactions might %
% be a first step into the direction of a more fundamental valuation of cryptocurrencies. %
%
% % Separating the money stock into a hoarded, illiquid component and a liquid, %
% money-like component has, among others, been reviewed and criticized %
% by~\cite{likitkijsomboon2005marx} and \cite{roche1985marx}. %
% % The theory has been criticized from various perspectives. %
% While we apply certain aspects of the anti-quantity equation of money to %
% modify the classical velocity of money 
% with the goal of defining a well interpretable and robust measure for the %
% "moneyness" of a cryptocurrency , establishing the anti-quantity theory of %
% money as model of thought for cryptocurrencies is not the objective of %
% this paper. However, the application of the anti-quantity equation of money, %
% still can be seen as a deviation from mainstream economics that mandates %
% thorough justification.
% 
% Most importantly, it should be emphasized, that our velocity definition %
% draws only from three basic concepts within the anti-quantity theory of %
% money: %
% Firstly, the separation of the money stock into a investment-like and a %
% money-like component; secondly, the law-of-reflux described earlier and %
% lastly the tautological form of the of the money equation. %
% This mitigates several issues. %
% For example, an important point of criticism regarding the theory arises %
% around the argumentation chain around modeling the equality of the %
% price-sum of transactions and the product of the money supply and velocity. %
% The equality is established using supply-demand arguments \todo{Which ones?}, %
% which conflicts with the law-of-reflux establishing independence between %
% supply and value of money (\cite{likitkijsomboon2005marx}). %
% This indeed highlights a conceptional inconsistency of the anti-quantity %
% equation theory. %
% It still holds, however, that the equation establishes a tautology at %
% any given point in time when seen in isolation. %
% This tautology suffices as basis for a mechanical definition of the %
% velocity of money.
% 
% Also, cryptocurrency markets are very different from full-blown economies. %%
% One major point of criticism is that the law-of-reflux might draw an %
% improper picture of the economy. %
% Surges in the money-demand due to an increased demand for the transaction %
% volume of goods would be compensated entirely by money flowing from money %
% hoards into circulation. %
% Likewise, increases of the total money stock would be absorbed quickly %
% by the hoarding component of money (\cite{likitkijsomboon2005marx}). %
% While this indeed seems odd \todo{explain} for national economies, for %
% cryptocurrencies the situation is different: %
% It seems plausible, that an increase in the demand for transactions %
% (often for speculative reasons) %
% draws to a high degree from long-term invested money.%
% \footnote{%
%		And indication for that has been offered earlier in %
%		[missing diagram introduced already above].%
% } %
% Also it does not seem implausible at all, that newly mined coins are %
% flowing first into money hoards and are used in transactions only when needed. %
% 
% An indication might be offered by staleness of newly mined coins that is %
% illuminated in \textbf{[missing diagram [see above: 1.eD1, 1.eD2, 1.cD1 + 4.eD1]]}. %
%
% Many other points of criticisms refer to irreconcilability of the theory %
% with realities of national economies (compare \cite{lavoie1986marx}, %
% \cite{foley2005marx} or \cite{likitkijsomboon2005marx}) and fortunately %
% are of little importance to the application for cryptocurrencies. %
% \todo{If we feel fruity, we might make this an own section and argue for %
% that theory in more detail. I would favor a simple and quick justification though.}
% For example, it has been criticized that the theory impedes the explanation %
% of trade imbalances and shifts in the foreign exchange markets, leads to unrealistic %
% characterizations of the market for loans, and the assumption of banks %
% following the real bills doctrine (\cite{likitkijsomboon2005marx}). %
% 
% However, the theory might be criticized on a very fundamental level. %
% Hoarded money and money in circulation are lastly indistinguishable and %
% differ only in their velocity of money. Classical monetary theorists see %
% money hoards simply as a subgroup of money with a velocity of zero. %
% [Note: This is argument is just "mäh". ]
